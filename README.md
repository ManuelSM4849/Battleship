# Battleship

Welcome to the Battleship Game! This is a Python-based implementation of the classic Battleship game with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter and Matplotlib. The game allows players to place ships manually or randomly and then engage in a strategic battle against an AI opponent.

**Features**
Manual Ship Placement: Players can place their ships manually on the board.
Random Ship Placement: Option for players to place ships randomly.
AI Opponent: An AI opponent that uses probability to decide its moves.
Real-time Game Updates: Visual updates on hits, misses, and sunk ships.
Game History: Records and displays each move made by both the player and the AI.

**Installation**
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/ManuelSM4849/Battleship.git
cd battleship

**Install the required dependencies**
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Running the Game**
To start the game, simply run the Battleship.py file:
python Battleship.py

**Game Interface**
Player's Board: The left board displays the player's ships, hits, and misses.
AI's Board: The right board shows the AI's hits and misses on the player's board.
Message Boxes: Display updates about the game's progress, including hits, misses, and which ships have been sunk.

**Game Rules**
Each player (you and the AI) has a fleet of ships to place on their board.
Ships can be placed either horizontally or vertically.
Players take turns to call shots at the opponent's board.
The game indicates if the shot is a hit or miss.
The goal is to sink all the opponent's ships before they sink yours.
